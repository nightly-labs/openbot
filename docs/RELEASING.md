# Releasing OpenBot

OpenBot updates are published through GitHub Releases and installed with `electron-updater`.
macOS requires every auto-updatable build to be signed with a Developer ID Application certificate.
The release workflow also notarizes and staples the macOS application before publishing it. Windows
x64 releases are currently unsigned, so Windows can show an Unknown publisher or SmartScreen warning.
Both platforms must pass before one release is published. A release also requires the pinned Sunshine
and Moonlight Web runtime artifacts. GitHub Actions downloads those artifacts, checks SHA-256, and
verifies their native executables as part of the final OpenBot package. Release packages are not built
on a developer machine.

Codex, Claude, and Grok runtimes are optional downloads. They are not part of the application package.
Release CI downloads the pinned macOS and Windows provider artifacts as control artifacts. It checks
their SHA-256 values, versions, licenses, and vendor signatures without copying them into OpenBot.

## One-time GitHub setup

Create the `release` environment in `NorbertBodziony/openbot`, then add these environment secrets:

- `CSC_LINK` — a base64-encoded Developer ID Application `.p12` file.
- `MAC_PROVISIONING_PROFILE` — the base64-encoded Developer ID provisioning profile for
  `app.openbot.desktop`, with the `applinks:openbot.run` entitlement.
- `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` — the `.p12` export password.
- `APPLE_ID` — the Apple Account used for notarization.
- `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` — a dedicated app-specific password for `notarytool`.
- `APPLE_TEAM_ID` — the Apple Developer team ID.

Do not use an Apple Development certificate. Direct distribution and native macOS updates require a
Developer ID Application certificate. Never commit signing credentials to the repository.

Windows signing credentials are not currently configured. The workflow explicitly verifies that the
OpenBot executable and NSIS installer remain unsigned, while retaining package, runtime, updater,
checksum, SBOM, and provenance checks.

## Build the remote desktop runtime

`native-runtime.lock.json` pins the OpenBot forks of Sunshine `v2026.516.143833` and Moonlight Web
`v2.10.0` by full commit and source archive SHA-256. Each entry also records its exact upstream base
commit and the reviewable OpenBot patch. Build on the target platform:

```bash
bun run build:remote-desktop-runtime
bun run verify:remote-desktop-runtime
```

The command writes binaries, the static Moonlight viewer, GPL-3.0 licenses, corresponding-source
metadata, and SHA-256 checksums under `build/remote-desktop-runtime/<platform>/<arch>`. Publish the
exact corresponding source for both GPL components with every binary release. A release must stop if
a binary, license, source manifest, checksum, platform signature, or notarization result is missing.

Use this source build only to make or reproduce a runtime version. The
`.github/workflows/remote-desktop-runtime.yml` workflow builds macOS ARM64 and Windows x64 when the
recipe or a pinned input changes. It publishes an immutable GitHub prerelease named
`remote-desktop-runtime-<input-digest>`. The prerelease contains both deterministic archives, SPDX
SBOMs, build provenance, and `remote-desktop-runtime-manifest.json`. It is not an OpenBot application
update and it must never contain `latest.yml`.

After publication, the workflow opens a draft PR that adds the release tag and SHA-256 values to
`native-runtime.lock.json`. That job runs only from `main`, because it pins against the lock it checks
out: the input digest is derived from the recipe on disk, and a manifest built from a different recipe
is refused.

So a branch that changes the recipe pins by hand, and must, or merging it leaves `main` with an
unpinned lock -- which is not a degraded state but a broken one, because
`prepare-remote-desktop-runtime.ts` throws and takes every `package`, `dist:mac` and `dist:win` run
with it. From the branch:

```bash
gh workflow run remote-desktop-runtime.yml --ref <branch>
# once Publish and Verify published are green:
gh release download remote-desktop-runtime-<input-digest> --pattern remote-desktop-runtime-manifest.json
bun scripts/pin-remote-desktop-runtime.ts remote-desktop-runtime-manifest.json
```

Commit the rewritten `native-runtime.lock.json` to the branch and merge it with the recipe, so `main`
never sees the two apart. The pin does not change the input digest -- it covers `recipeVersion`, both
source entries and `targets`, not the artifacts -- so it cannot invalidate the release it just pinned.

Normal CI and application release jobs then use:

```bash
bun run install:remote-desktop-runtime
bun run verify:remote-desktop-runtime
```

The installer accepts only the exact prerelease and assets in the lock file. It rejects a changed
manifest, a changed archive, an unsafe archive path, and a mismatched source manifest. Do not replace
assets in an existing runtime prerelease. Increase `recipeVersion` when the build process changes.

## Publish a version

Start from a clean, up-to-date `main` branch. For the first release, `package.json` and
`CHANGELOG.md` are already prepared as `0.1.0`; after CI passes, create its annotated tag directly:

```bash
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "OpenBot v0.1.0"
git push origin v0.1.0
```

For later releases, add the release notes under `Unreleased`, then choose the appropriate semantic
version bump:

```bash
bun run release:patch
# or: bun run release:minor
# or: bun run release:major
```

The command updates `package.json` and moves the unreleased changelog entries under the new dated
version heading. Review and publish that preparation before creating the tag:

```bash
git add package.json CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "release: prepare vX.Y.Z"
git push origin main
bun run release:preflight
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "OpenBot vX.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

Pushing the version tag runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
The tag workflow starts only after `https://openbot.run/join` and the Apple association file return
direct `200` responses with the required security headers, MIME type, app ID, and `/join` scope.

The workflow:

1. verifies the tag matches `package.json`;
2. installs and verifies the pinned remote desktop runtime without CMake or Cargo;
3. runs the complete offline repository check;
4. builds signed and notarized ARM64 DMG and ZIP artifacts on a GitHub macOS runner;
5. builds an unsigned Windows x64 NSIS installer on a GitHub Windows runner;
6. verifies both unpacked applications, update metadata, included runtimes, provider control artifacts,
   licenses, checksums, platform signing contracts, launch behavior, and update artifact size limits;
7. generates SPDX SBOMs and GitHub build-provenance attestations for both platforms;
8. publishes one non-draft GitHub Release only after both platform jobs pass.

Users can verify a downloaded artifact with
`gh attestation verify <file> --repo NorbertBodziony/openbot`.

Installed OpenBot builds check for updates shortly after launch and every four hours. New versions
download automatically while **Automatically download updates** is on, which is the default and is
persisted per user in `openbot-update-preference-v1.json`; with the setting off, a download starts
only on a user action. The account popover shows the current state and lets the user download an
available version, then restart into it. The restart action appears as
soon as the download completes on both platforms, and neither platform installs without that
explicit action, because `autoInstallOnAppQuit` stays off so shutdown preparation always runs. Every
stage the user waits on is bounded by a timeout and recorded in `logs/update/update.log`, so a failed
check, download, or restart reports an actionable error and can be retried in place.

The Whisper executable is part of the application. The `ggml-medium-q5_0.bin` model is not part of an
application or update artifact. OpenBot downloads the pinned model on first voice use, checks its size
and SHA-256, and keeps the verified file in the user data directory for later offline use.

The release workflow stops if the macOS update ZIP or Windows NSIS installer is larger than 700 MiB,
or if the DMG is larger than 750 MiB. It also stops if update metadata has a wrong size or SHA-512, if
the Whisper model is present, or if the application contains a second native Claude runtime.

If a release is bad, publish a newer patch version. Do not replace an already published version with
different binaries.

Before working this checklist, audit the changes since the last released tag with the
`.agents/skills/release-upgrade-safety/` skill: it covers the upgrade and data-loss hazards an
installed user cannot undo — the in-place database migration, the `userData` files nothing backs up,
the frozen Team API adapters, and the D1 migrations that race their own deploy.

## Preflight checklist

Before creating the first tag or any later release:

0. run the Team API compatibility matrix for every protocol that remains in the adapter registry. The matrix must cover an older client with the new host, the new client with an older host, matching versions, no shared protocol, capability omission, unknown optional events, and malformed known events. Do not reduce this matrix because a protocol is old or because many application versions separate the peers. Confirm that each supported protocol still has unchanged client and host fixtures;

1. run `bun run release:preflight` and resolve every reported release-secret or repository gate;
2. confirm the `release` environment contains all six macOS secrets above; Windows remains unsigned;
3. confirm the production `/join` page and Apple association file pass the deployment checks in CI;
4. run `bun install --frozen-lockfile` and `bun run check` from a clean clone;
5. run `bun run package:verify` on macOS; Windows packaging and launch verification run on the release
   runner;
6. confirm that the lock file contains all six provider artifacts, their download and install sizes,
   and that their install checks pass;
7. smoke-test sign-in/setup, chat streaming, queues, attachments, agent messaging, browser control,
   context compaction, and the update popover;
8. on macOS ARM64 and Windows x64, update from the last public version and confirm check, download,
   preparation, explicit restart, new version, local agents, conversations, and queues;
9. test first voice use, download progress, retry after a stopped download, transcription, and cached
   offline use;
10. build a signed and notarized canary and test an update from the official `0.1.21` application on
   macOS 26 with a separate `userData` directory;
11. confirm the canary update does not crash in `CFURLConnectionSynchronous`, preserves data, starts
    the new version, and can run three provider downloads with restricted memory;
12. on Windows 10 and 11 x64, confirm that normal exit, restart, and sign-out do not start NSIS, while
    `Restart and install` does start it;
13. confirm `CHANGELOG.md` describes the version and the working tree is clean;
14. create and push the version commit and tag only after CI passes on `main`.

The macOS ZIP must be smaller than 800,000,000 bytes and smaller than the official `0.1.21` ZIP.
Do not publish when either size gate fails, the `0.1.21` canary update crashes, or Windows starts NSIS
during shutdown or sign-out.

The unsigned local macOS package is a development artifact. It does not prove Gatekeeper,
notarization, or auto-update readiness. Those are proven only by the signed release workflow's
`codesign`, `spctl`, and `stapler` checks.

After publishing `v0.1.0`, keep one installed copy and use the first signed patch (`v0.1.1`) as the
end-to-end updater acceptance test: check, download, restart, and confirm the version changed without
losing local agents or queues. This cannot be proven with an unsigned development build because macOS
updaters require both versions to share a valid Developer ID signature.
