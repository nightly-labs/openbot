# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenBot will be documented here. The project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Finish naming the product concept **agent** everywhere: identifiers, IPC channels, CSS, copy, the
  mobile app, and the instructions and tool parameters the models read. Existing agent identifiers are
  rewritten from `bot-<uuid>` to `agent-<uuid>` and every workspace moves from `~/OpenBot/Bots` to
  `~/OpenBot/Agents` on first launch. The Team API wire protocol is unchanged — versions 1 to 3 still
  spell the agent `botId`, and a translation layer converts.
- **Paired phones must be unpaired and paired again after this update.** A phone stores the agent
  identifiers it was given, and those identifiers have changed, so its pins and unread markers point at
  agents the host no longer knows. Chats open normally again once the phone is re-paired; nothing on the
  computer is lost.

### Fixed

- Import EML messages as single, unchanged chat attachments for agents to inspect directly.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- Persist and restore the main application window position between launches.

### Fixed

- Apply the **Automatically download updates** setting: it is now persisted in the user data directory and drives the
  updater, instead of being a renderer-only value that reset on every launch and never started a download.
- Stop macOS updates hanging on **Preparing update…**: the restart action is offered as soon as the download completes
  rather than waiting for a native staging event that never arrived, and the phase that could hang is gone.
- Bound every update stage: a check, download, or restart that stops responding now reports an actionable error instead
  of waiting indefinitely. A failed download is retried in place; a failed install asks for a relaunch, because shutdown
  preparation cannot be repeated safely.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- Stabilize the signed macOS release gate by running the full repository test suite with bounded Vitest concurrency.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- Add a self-hosted Bun Signal service, coturn, DNS-01 certificate renewal, and Docker Compose deployment under `remote/`.
- Add WebRTC Team API protocol v2 with RPC, ordered events, binary file transfer, backpressure, integrity checks, and resume support.

### Changed

- Identify signed-in desktop accounts in OpenPanel with normalized email profile traits and ordered event delivery; keep development builds and localhost analytics-free.
- Keep accounts, host configuration, memberships, invitations, logical sessions, and public assets in Cloudflare while remote data uses WebRTC only.
- Remove `cloudflared` from the active host transport and from macOS and Windows application packages.
- Require old Team API clients and hosts to update before they can use the retired tunnel endpoints.

### Fixed

- Keep the embedded browser panel closed until requested and prevent repeated toggles from opening duplicate tabs.
- Restore embedded X sign-in with persistent cookie consent, a compatible browser identity, and current login routing.
- Flush the embedded browser profile before restarts, system shutdowns, and application updates so authenticated sessions persist.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added

- Add a macOS Dynamic Island overlay for messages, questions, approvals, browser takeovers, and failures.
- Add persistent question prompt bubbles with safe handling for secret answers.
- Let agents attach local response images with preview, download, and file actions.

### Fixed

## [0.3.5] - 2026-08-27

### Changed

- Remove provider runtimes from macOS and Windows application packages while keeping system CLIs as the first choice.
- Install application updates only after the user selects `Restart and install`.

### Added

- Download Codex, Claude, and Grok provider runtimes on demand from pinned vendor artifacts.
- Show provider download, setup, retry, and connection actions in onboarding, Settings, Bot setup, and model selection.

### Fixed

- Wait for native macOS update staging before offering a restart, and require an explicit update restart on Windows.
- Reject oversized or inconsistent release artifacts and remove duplicate native runtime files from packages.
- Stream large provider downloads to disk, support safe resume, and reject unsafe or invalid runtime archives.
- Respect Windows shutdown and sign-out without starting the NSIS updater.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-08-26

- Present embedded browser requests as standard Chrome requests so X login and signup flows work.
- Restart expired X onboarding routes from the stable login entry after an app restart.
