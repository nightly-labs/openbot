/**
 * The two directions the macOS Dynamic Island talks in, for the server the user
 * is actually looking at: the projection out to main, and the actions coming
 * back.
 *
 * `dynamic-island.tsx` sits above every per-server domain and cannot read them -
 * it holds the coordinator and the background-server events. This is its
 * counterpart at the bottom of the tree, where the nine signals the projection
 * needs are readable. Splitting them is what keeps the coordinator alive across a
 * server switch while the projection stays scoped to the active one.
 *
 * The projection is withheld until the scope reports `loaded()`. Without that, a
 * mount would publish the new server's id next to a half-filled workspace for
 * exactly as long as its loads take. The flag is a boolean rather than a server
 * id because the scope it belongs to *is* one server: it starts false on every
 * mount and cannot describe the wrong one.
 *
 * Actions arrive for *any* server, including one that is not active, which is why
 * `handleDynamicIslandAction` may switch before it can act - and why it then
 * republishes the action through `server-switch.tsx` instead of finishing it: the
 * switch disposes this bridge, so the scope that lands has to run the rest. The
 * two that never need a switch - answering a prompt and responding to an
 * approval - resolve against the coordinator directly and republish, so a reply
 * from the island is reflected before the renderer has caught up.
