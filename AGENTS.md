# Repository guidance

Two tiers. **Non-negotiable** items protect user data, released contracts, or the security boundary;
trade one away only on the developer's explicit decision. Everything else is a **default** their
preference overrides — if they ask for something this file discourages, do it and say what you set
aside. Never argue back by citing this file.

## Non-negotiable

- **Migrations are irreversible.** Nothing copies `openbot.db` before an upgrade. Preserve all user
  data, support every shipped source schema, never assume a backup exists.
- **Released Team API adapters are permanent.** A shipped wire protocol never changes meaning.
- **The renderer-to-main trust boundary holds** — Electron sandboxing, context isolation, navigation
  policy, IPC sender validation, and their tests. Agents already run with `danger-full-access`; the
  process boundary is what is left.
- **Secrets stay redacted** on every path that logs, exports, or sends, diagnostics and analytics
  included.
- **The licence is PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0.** No dependency that conflicts with it, no
  relicensed file.

The first three are spelled out where they are enforced — `src/backend/AGENTS.md`,
`packages/contracts/AGENTS.md` and `src/main/AGENTS.md`. `CONTRIBUTING.md` "Security-sensitive
changes" lists the boundaries in full; `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` "Change rules" says where a change
belongs.

## CI owns the minutes-long suites. Run the fast checks yourself.

A fresh worktree has no `node_modules`, and every command below dies with `biome: command not found`
or `Cannot find module '@openbot/logging'` until it does. Run `bun install --frozen-lockfile` first,
or `bun scripts/prepare-dev-environment.ts`, which adds the local D1 migration and asserts the Bun
version and the `.env.keys` `.worktreeinclude` carries across.

Before you call a task done, run the narrowest test for what you touched, then `bun run lint` and
`bun run typecheck` — plus `bun run check:ui` if you touched `src/renderer`, which scans the whole
renderer in 60 ms. All three read more than you changed on purpose and none is expensive: `lint` is
`biome check --max-diagnostics=none .` across every file in about six seconds, `typecheck` is eleven
`tsc` projects in about four. The wide typecheck is the more useful one — a change in
`packages/contracts` surfaces as an error in `src/renderer` or `src/main`, which a single `tsc -p`
on the project you edited never sees. The `lint` flag is load-bearing: Biome caps a report at 20
diagnostics by default, and it prints the honest total but not the findings past the cap, so a
cleanup pass without it costs one full-repo run per 20.

`bun run typecheck` is `typecheck:*`, and `typecheck:mobile` is in that glob, so `apps/mobile` is
checked with everything else — it depends on `@openbot/brand`, `@openbot/contracts` and
`@openbot/team-client`, and an export change in any of them breaks the app. It used to be named
`mobile:typecheck`, which the glob missed, and this file used to carry a paragraph asking you to
remember that. `mobile:typecheck` survives as an alias because CI's Surfaces job calls it by that
name. It runs `expo customize` and a `uniwind` codegen before `tsc`, but everything it writes is
gitignored, so the aggregate still leaves your diff alone.

`remote/api` is in the glob for the same reason, as `typecheck:remote`. Its tests cover ticket
verification, session revocation and TURN credentials — the Signal service's whole auth boundary —
and when the workspace arrived nothing ran them, because its only entry point was `remote:check`,
which also validates both Compose files. The workspace's own `check` needs nothing but Bun and
finishes in three seconds, so the halves are split — `typecheck:remote` and `test:remote` run in
Surfaces and Tests beside the other non-desktop surfaces, and `remote:check:compose` is the rest.
`docker compose config` interpolates client-side and never opens a socket, so the Compose half needs
the docker CLI but no daemon and runs in Surfaces too; `remote:check` remains the local superset.
Nothing in CI builds the image, though, and its Dockerfile installs from a pruned checkout —
one `COPY` per workspace — so a `workspace:*` dependency added to the root manifest breaks
`remote:up` while every job stays green. `scripts/dependency-catalog.test.ts` is what notices now:
it walks the workspace dependency graph and asserts a manifest is copied for each one it reaches.

`remote/scripts` rides along in that same project. `check.ts` and `update.ts` are Bun scripts
using `Bun.spawn` and `import.meta.dir`, and no `tsconfig` reached them: `tsconfig.node.json` stops
at the root `scripts/**` and pins `"types": ["node"]`, which is why no root script uses the `Bun`
global at all. Adding `@types/bun` at the root would have made Bun globals resolvable repo-wide,
including in `src/main`, which runs under Node. Instead `remote/api` already had the Bun-typed
project the scripts needed, so its `include` carries `../scripts/*.ts` and
`typecheck:remote` covers both. `update.ts` drains and force-recreates the live coturn container, so
it is worth a checker.

Do not run `bun run check`, `check:desktop`, `test`, or `build-storybook`: each takes minutes, and
the desktop suite flakes under load, so a red result tells you nothing about your change. That is
where the line falls — how long a command takes and whether you can trust its result, not how many
files it reads. CI owns all of it on every push:

| CI job | Runner | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Check | `macos-14` | `bun run check:desktop` |
| Tests | `ubuntu-latest` | `bun run test:desktop`, `bun run test:sites`, `bun run test:remote` |
| Surfaces | `ubuntu-latest` | `bun run mobile:typecheck`, `bun run typecheck:sites`, `bun run typecheck:team-client`, `bun run typecheck:remote`, `bun run remote:check:compose` |
| API | `ubuntu-latest` | `bun run check:api` |
| Storybook build | `ubuntu-latest` | `bun run build-storybook` |

All five gate the Cloudflare production deploy on a push to `main`. Surfaces did not until recently,
so a red mobile, site-router, team-client or remote typecheck let the deploy through.

`bun run test:desktop -- <path>` runs one desktop file. Need something wider? Ask for it. Permission
covers the one command named — not another one, not a build, not a packaged app.

`bun run format` is the one fast command to leave alone: it is
`biome check --write --max-diagnostics=none .`, so it rewrites files your task never touched and
puts them in your diff. Fix what you changed with `biome check --write <paths>`, or let the
pre-commit hook's `bun run check:staged` do it over the staged set.

## Hit every surface

A change that works on the path you happened to open is the most common half-change here. **Say
which of these your change touched.**

- **Desktop renderer** (`src/renderer`), **mobile** (`apps/mobile`), **public web**
  (`apps/auth-api` — there is no separate landing app), **self-hosted Signal service**
  (`remote/api`, which the desktop app and the phone both connect through).
- **IPC contracts** in `packages/contracts`, and their second implementation
  `src/renderer/src/preview/mock-openbot.ts`, which Storybook and the preview run against.
- **Reverse states.** Snooze needs unsnooze, pause resume, revoke reconnect, mute unmute. A state a
  user can enter and not leave is a bug.
- **Migrations**, plus the separate latest schema used for new databases.
- **Documentation**: the `README.md` command table, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `PRIVACY.md` when
  what leaves the machine changes.

## The three ways to hurt yourself

1. **The user's development database.** `bun run dev:seed` destroys and replaces the whole
   `OpenBot Dev` profile — real conversations, agents, transfers — and its staging copy is deleted
   on success, so it is not a safety net. `bun run dev:reset` deletes the app, test-client and legacy
   host profiles. Never run either unless asked; `dev:seed --dry-run` inspects without touching
   anything.
2. **The shared dev stack.** Several agents work in worktrees on this machine at once, sharing one
   profile and one set of default ports, so a second `bun run dev` fights the first and can leave a
   half-written profile behind. Reuse the running instance, or get an isolated one with
   `developmentUserDataName(profile, instanceId)` in `src/main/development-profile.ts`. Drive the
   running instance for e2e smoke checks with `bun run dev:automation` instead of launching Electron
   yourself. Each dev instance publishes its worktree, profile and ports, so
   `bun run dev:automation instances` lists what is live and a command run inside a worktree drives
   that worktree's app. `snapshot`/`screenshot` are read-only; `click`/`type` need
   `--allow-mutations` and an instance that was named rather than inferred — the record of this
   worktree counts, `--instance=<id>` and `--port=` name one outright, and another worktree's app is
   readable but never clickable. Nothing about a dev window is off limits: `pages` lists every
   target and `--page=<target-id|url-substring>` drives any of them, including a Dynamic Island surface
   or an embedded browser view. The app window is only what you get when you aim at nothing. `--wait-for=<role>,<name>` settles on an
  accessible target before a capture and after a mutation, so a flow needs no snapshot loop.
3. **Killing processes by pattern.** `pkill -f electron` or `pkill -f bun` kills other sessions' work
   mid-write. Target a PID you started, or ask.

## Words we use

- **agent** — three unrelated senses: the OpenBot product concept (`AgentStore`, `AgentSummary`,
  `agent-${uuid}`, `~/OpenBot/Agents/<id>`, table `projection_agents`); a *coding* agent working on
  this repository; a *marketplace* agent (`ipc-marketplace-agents.ts`). **teammate** is prompt and
  marketing copy, never a type. Human team members are `TeamMemberSummary`.
- **bot** — never the product concept in new code. Where it survives it is frozen, and each place can
  say why: the Team API v1-v3 wire spells the agent `bot`/`botId`/`bots-changed` and always will
  (`current-agent-keys.ts` is the only translator); `bots.json`, `mailbox.json` and
  `legacy-import:bots:v1` are names a shipped release already wrote to disk; the `~/OpenBot/Bots`
  path prefixes stay readable forever; `"first-bot"` is an avatar seed, not a word; and `BloubBot`
  and lucide's `Bot` icon belong to their libraries. A `bot-<uuid>` id value is still valid — a
  database restored from the user's own file copy never ran migration v13.
- **server** — four senses: a remote team server you join (`ServerSummary`, `servers:*` IPC); your
  own Team API host (`HostStatus`, `host:*` IPC, `src/main/team-api-server.ts`); the cloud account
  API (`apps/auth-api`, `auth:*` IPC); an MCP server (`createSdkMcpServer`).
- **thread** is the durable record (`projection_threads`); **conversation** its read projection (no
  table — an IPC and renderer word); **provider session** the deliberately private CLI-side resume
  state (`projection_provider_sessions`); **team session** an authenticated remote connection;
  **turn** the unit of exchange inside a thread.
- **routine** — a scheduled standing instruction attached to one agent (`projection_agent_routines`).
  Not the Claude Code `/schedule` sense.

## What OpenBot is

Four invariants you cannot derive from the code. Check a change against them before optimizing
something else.

- **Local-first, not offline-only.** Workspaces, conversations, attachments, browser data and team
  data stay on the computer that runs OpenBot. Codex still connects to OpenAI, Claude to Anthropic,
  Grok to xAI, and visited pages and plugins use the network. Both halves are true.
- **No cloud dependency for core function.** Cloudflare holds accounts, avatars, host configuration,
  memberships, invitations and logical sessions — never chats, files or commands. The app works
  without an account.
- **The user's SQLite is the source of truth**, not a cache of something remote. This is why
  migrations are irreversible and a backup cannot be assumed.
- **Teammates persist.** An agent keeps its workspace, thread and identity across provider switches
  and restarts. Resetting an agent to get a cleaner state changes the product.

## Where the rest of this lives

Seven directories carry rules this file used to hold. Each is loaded when you open a file under it,
and each says what its own boundary costs and how to wait in its tests.

| File | What it owns |
| --- | --- |
| `src/renderer/AGENTS.md` | the prerelease SolidJS stack, one store per concern, component reuse, the palette |
| `src/main/AGENTS.md` | the renderer-to-main trust boundary, and where an IPC endpoint is registered |
| `src/main/ipc/AGENTS.md` | the four ways to bind a handler, and the steps to add an endpoint |
| `src/backend/AGENTS.md` | the user's SQLite: irreversible migrations, and the two database build paths |
| `packages/contracts/AGENTS.md` | the Team API wire protocol, and the one channel list with its manifest and two mirrors |
| `apps/auth-api/AGENTS.md` | the account Worker, and why its D1 migrations must survive a deploy race |
| `apps/mobile/AGENTS.md` | the Expo app, and the build and simulator commands that need explicit permission |

Read the one for the directory you are changing before you change it. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
"Change rules" says where a change belongs when it is not obvious.

One file is scoped to a task rather than a directory: `.agents/skills/release-upgrade-safety/` audits
the diff since the last released tag for the upgrade and data-loss hazards an installed user cannot
undo, and nothing opens it for you — reach for it when a version is about to be bumped or tagged.

## Tests

1. **The default answer is no test.** Prefer changing an existing test to adding one. A new test
   names the consequence it protects; a new test *file* needs a boundary that does not exist yet.
2. **Watch it fail.** Break what it covers — change the value, delete the guard, return early — and
   confirm it goes red *for the reason you meant*. Still green means it tests nothing; "expected 3
   children, got 2" means it tests the tree, so fix the assertion before restoring the code. No
   linter can run this check, and it is what separates a test from a costume. Say in the PR that you
   did it.
3. **Check whether something already enforces it.** `tsc`, Biome with its GritQL rules, and
   `bun run check:ui` cover a large class mechanically. If one of them does, skip the test.
4. **A test that needs a timeout to pass is wrong.** Wait on an observable condition — a state
   change, an emitted event, a resolved promise — never the clock. A sleep long enough to pass on
   your machine is short enough to flake on a loaded runner. A spy call is such a condition:
   `await waitFor(() => expect(send).toHaveBeenCalled())` is the sanctioned way to satisfy this
   rule, and is not the mock-shaped assertion the module-mock warning is about. The barrier
   synchronizes; the assertions after it carry the consequence. Counting `toHaveBeenCalled*` across
   the suite cannot tell the two apart, so do not "fix" a barrier by grep.
5. **Test behaviour, data, and accessible roles and names** — not markup, classes, layout or
   animation timing. Where focus lands *is* behaviour: assert it with `toHaveFocus()`. Assert exact
   text only for a product contract, an error or security message, serialized output, or a
   localization key. Visual detail belongs in a Storybook story.
6. **The file name picks the vitest project.** `*.test.ts` runs in `node` with no DOM, `*.test.tsx`
   renders JSX in jsdom, `*.dom.test.ts` is the narrow case of a DOM without a component. Needing
   either of the last two for logic means the logic is not separable yet.
7. **A test is mandatory** at the renderer-to-main trust boundary, the IPC contract, database schema
   and migrations, persisted state, secrets, the provider process boundary, the Team API wire
   protocol, and the updater — at the lowest stable boundary, once, not at both the component and the
   application level.

Before adding an assertion, ask what a user or a caller would see differently if it failed. "A class
name changed", "the colour changed", "the element moved", "the tree grew a node" — drop it; colour
and layout belong in a story, the tree nowhere. How you reach the element counts too: a `data-testid`
is a hook the product does not otherwise need and a CSS class is a styling detail, so both pin the
test to markup that is free to change. Query by accessible role and name; nothing accessible to query
is an accessibility gap in the component, not a reason for a test id. A snapshot is the same failure
in bulk — it names no consequence, so it gets updated, not read.

Biome enforces the mechanical half and only that. In test files it rejects `toHaveClass`,
`toHaveStyle`, `getComputedStyle`, `toContainElement`, `toHaveAttribute("title", …)`,
`expect(x.innerHTML)`, DOM-tree walks, `querySelector("svg" | "img")`, `document.activeElement`,
snapshots, the `*ByTestId` queries, an assertion reached through a CSS class, an awaited bare
`setTimeout`, and `it.only`. It does not see a `data-testid` attribute itself — a GritQL rule cannot
read the product tree from a test file — so `check:ui` carries that half instead, as a budget frozen
at the five the renderer has today. It is a budget rather than a ban because three of the five are
read by play functions in `src/renderer/stories`, which is sanctioned: a sixth hook has to replace
one of those, and an accessible role and name is the only other way in. All of it stays available in
`src/renderer/stories`, where it belongs. Around
focus only `document.activeElement` is rejected: it asserts against the document instead of the
element the test already holds, and fails with "expected null" rather than naming the control.
`toHaveFocus()` is encouraged.

Two severities. **Error** is for patterns with no honest counter-example: a snapshot, a test id, a
sleep. **Warning** is for a judgement a pattern cannot make — an `object` parameter, a module mock.
A warning is a prompt to think, never a demand to rewrite; `biome-ignore` is not available to you, so
making correct code worse to silence one is the one wrong answer. Leave it and say why in the PR.

Every rule in `tools/biome/anti-slop/rules` owns a fixture in `../fixtures` marking each rejected
line with `// flag` beside correct code it must leave alone; `scripts/anti-slop-rules.test.ts` checks
both halves. A pattern that matches nothing is green and enforces nothing — that is how one rule
stayed blind to `querySelector<HTMLElement>` for months. A new rule without a fixture is not a rule.

A rule here bans a spelling, not a decision, and it does not repeat one Biome already ships.
`no-runtime-typeof` was deleted for failing the first test: GritQL sees no types, so it could not
separate `typeof` narrowing an `unknown` at a trust boundary from `typeof` on a value the compiler
already knows, and all sixteen of its standing warnings turned out to be the correct use — which
taught readers to skim the warning class that `no-module-mocking` lives in.
`no-chained-type-assertions` was deleted for failing the second: `noUnsafeTypeAssertion` is already
an error and reported every chain it caught, while the rule was blind to the unparenthesised
`value as unknown as T` spelling. `noExplicitAny` owns `any` for the same reason. Cost is the
tiebreaker when a rule is merely thin: each plugin is a separate traversal of every file, priced by
how common its head pattern is, so a rule keyed on `const $name = $value` costs more than the rest of
the linter put together — that is what `no-shape-in-symbol-names` cost to enforce a naming
preference that review already covers.

`bun run check:ui` is held to the same contract by `tools/ui-foundation/fixtures` and
`scripts/ui-foundation-check.test.ts`. Two of its checks had gone blind before this existed. The
`renderer` tree breaks every check once, beside the correct neighbour each must leave alone;
`renderer-clean` breaks none of them, and carries the negative half for the checks that report
once per file rather than once per occurrence — in the first tree the violation accounts for the
failure whether or not the check has also started rejecting the correct code beside it. Adding a
check means adding to both.

## Pull requests

- **Never open a PR unless you were asked to.**
- Show before and after for a UI change, and state the model and harness in the body.
- Wider checks belong before the PR, not during it — ask for the specific command you need.

### Approvability

A PR is not auto-approvable, and needs a named reason in the body, when it adds a `biome-ignore`,
`@ts-expect-error` or `@ts-ignore`; adds a rule-disabling `overrides` entry to `biome.json` or
unregisters a GritQL plugin; or widens a type to `any` or `unknown` at a boundary or asserts past a
checker. These are the exact escape hatches the anti-slop rules exist to close: fix the finding at
the domain boundary, or say the rule is wrong for this case and let the developer decide.
